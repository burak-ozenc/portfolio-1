# BURAK ÖZENÇ - Presentation Script

## PERSONAL INTRODUCTION

Hi, I'm Burak Özenç. I'm a full-stack developer with over five years of experience in software development. My career path has been quite interesting. I spent about seven to eight years in hospitality operations, then worked for three years as a professional Tonmeister, which is a sound engineer, at a jazz club in Istanbul. After that, I transitioned into software development about six years ago.

I'm originally from Turkey, and I'm currently based in Serbia, in Belgrade. I'm a Turkish citizen and I'm open to relocation. I speak English fluently and I'm actively improving my German.

I have a dog named Brankica. It's a Serbian name, so it sounds like Brankitsa when you pronounce it. I enjoy playing basketball, and I'm a beginner trumpet player. I really enjoy the calm life here in Belgrade.

I born at 1990, in Turkey at August. 

My ultimate goal is to become a full-time musician in about fifteen years. Until then, I'm working as a software developer while building projects that merge my technical skills with my passion for music.

## EDUCATION

I started studying Material Science and Engineering about fifteen years ago, but I dropped out in my third year.

A few years ago, I started a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of London, but I had to pause it because of personal reasons.

I'm self-taught in software development. I completed CS50, Harvard's online computer science course, and I earned the certificate. I also have the Azure Fundamentals certification from Microsoft. I recently completed a Digital Audio Foundations certificate as well.

## CURRENT WORK AND PROJECTS

### TRUB.AI

I'm currently developing TRUB.AI, which is an AI-powered trumpet teaching assistant. This project is very personal to me because I created it to recreate my trumpet teacher, Imer Demirer. He's one of Turkey's greatest trumpet players who actually declined an invitation to tour with Herbie Hancock.

The architecture is quite comprehensive. I'm using Node.js and TypeScript for the backend API, which handles authentication with JWT and session management. For the audio analysis and pitch detection, I have a separate Python service using FastAPI. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using Redux for state management. I also integrate VexFlow for rendering sheet music and Recharts for visualizing practice progress. The database is PostgreSQL, and everything is containerized with Docker. I've deployed it to AWS EC2 with S3 storage.

TRUB.AI has several features. There's a real-time tuner and metronome. The play-along mode gives color-coded feedback on sheet music, showing whether notes are correct, close, or wrong. There are two practice modes. Wait Mode pauses until you play the correct note, and Flow Mode continues without stopping. The backend orchestrates communication between services and handles real-time pitch validation against expected notes from MIDI files.

I also built an AI chat interface that provides personalized feedback. It analyzes your playing across five dimensions: breath control, tone quality, rhythm, expression, and flexibility. There's progress tracking too.

For the audio machine learning component, I trained a binary audio classifier to detect trumpet sounds. I used two thousand trumpet samples and ten thousand non-trumpet samples. When I tested it with edge cases, like trying to distinguish a fly buzzing from trumpet sounds, the model failed. So I pivoted to a hybrid approach that combines machine learning with traditional signal processing using Python libraries. I'm still actively working on improving the model.

I also like to work on Node.js and TypeScript.

### AI Document Reader

At my previous company Umelle, I contributed to building a local AI Document Reader with a colleague. It was a team effort where I focused on the frontend, WebSocket implementation, and backend improvements. The product is a local web application that protects privacy through local LLM processing instead of cloud APIs.

The stack includes a React frontend that I built most of, a Python FastAPI backend, Ollama for running local LLMs, LangChain for document chunking, Weaviate as the vector database, and LangGraph for orchestration. We also created a WiX installer and a Windows Forms licensing application.

My specific contributions were quite varied. On the frontend, I wrote most of the UI, implemented WebSocket for real-time communication, created the documentation page, and designed the website skeleton. On the backend, I improved the RAG orchestration, created async processes and background tasks, added chat streaming, and refactored messy services to make them more maintainable. I also worked on the WiX installer and the Windows Forms app for license approval. I contributed to planning the SSL/TLS FQDN certificate process for user subdomains too.

The flow works like this: documents get chunked, then embedded, then stored in Weaviate. When users query through WebSocket, the RAG pipeline retrieves relevant chunks, and the LLM generates contextual responses. The high privacy requirements meant we spent a lot of time securing everything with local LLMs instead of cloud APIs.

I have production WebSocket experience from the AI Document Reader, and I've also used it in some previous freelance projects.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Umelle - Three Years, Finished January 2026

I worked at Umelle for three years, finishing in January 2026. I'm available immediately now. At Umelle, I worked on insurance data management systems for a public-private pool insurance company in California that serves districts, not individual policies. This means we managed aggregated district claim values, registrations, and regulatory reporting, not individual insurance policies.

The stack was C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL Server, Azure, DevExpress XAF, and DevExpress XAF-Blazor. For CI/CD, I used Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.

I spent significant time over those three years writing SQL. I designed database schemas for multi-district data aggregation, built complex SQL workflows for district claim value aggregations across time periods, did query optimization and performance tuning for large datasets, and generated compliance reports through SQL. I wrote a lot of stored procedures, functions, and views.

I built all the custom components for the insurance data management product using DevExpress XAF-Blazor. I have extensive production experience with Blazor Server architecture, component lifecycle management, and state handling. I used DevExpress Blazor UI components to create polished, enterprise-grade interfaces for district registrations, aggregated claim data management, and regulatory reporting workflows.

I used SignalR at Umelle for a messaging feature that was later cancelled, and in personal projects for chat integration and real-time approval systems.

One project that made a big impact was automating Excel work. I automated months of manual Excel data processing by building SQL-based workflows using stored procedures, functions, and views. This eliminated a lot of repetitive manual work.

I also worked on migrating a twenty-year-old legacy database to a new system. The challenge there was that there was no documentation, so I had to understand the existing structure by reverse engineering it.

I built Umelle's company website using React and TypeScript.

I used Azure for deploying applications to App Services in my personal projects and at Umelle. I used Entity Framework at Efectura, but at Umelle we used raw SQL instead.

### Efectura - One Year

Before Umelle, I worked at Efectura for one year. I worked on three concurrent projects, writing backend portions while coordinating with frontend teams. The stack was C#, .NET, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server.

I worked directly with enterprise clients including Silverline, PI Works, and Paycell. This involved requirements gathering and translating them into technical solutions.

At Paycell, there was a critical production performance issue. I analyzed the async/await implementation patterns, identified the bottlenecks, fixed the async patterns, and implemented caching strategies using Redis. This resolved the performance issues in the production system.

For Silverline, I built a REST API integration with SAP. I implemented a daily scheduled job for data synchronization with data mapping and create/update logic.

For PI Works, I built an integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365. I also integrated with BambooHR. I implemented OAuth-based authentication for these integrations.

I have professional React experience from building the AI Document Reader frontend and Umelle's company website. I also completed at least ten personal and freelance projects using React, mostly with JavaScript.

### Sound Engineering Background

My sound engineering background is practical and operational. I worked hands-on with mixing consoles like the Mackie 16. I selected and positioned microphones for different instruments, adjusted equalizers and gates, and solved acoustic challenges in live environments. For example, once I had to secure a shotgun microphone to the ceiling when there was no stand available.

I'm actively improving my theoretical DSP knowledge, and I recently completed a Digital Audio Foundations certificate. I understand codecs, sampling rates from a practical perspective, latency constraints, signal processing, and acoustic environments. I organized acoustic concerts and solved physical space problems too.

### Hospitality Background

Before becoming a sound engineer, I worked in hospitality operations for about ten years. I understand booking workflows, reservation systems, customer service processes, physical space optimization, and operational efficiency.

## TECHNICAL SKILLS

### What I Know Well

I have over five years of professional experience with C# and .NET. I've worked extensively with ASP.NET. I have extensive production experience with Blazor and Razor, particularly with DevExpress XAF and DevExpress Blazor UI components.

For databases, I'm very strong in SQL and Microsoft SQL Server. I have significant experience writing complex queries, stored procedures, functions, and doing optimization. I also work with PostgreSQL in my personal projects.

I work with Azure as my primary cloud platform, including App Services, Functions, Azure DevOps, SQL Azure, Storage, and Application Insights. For CI/CD, I use Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. I use Git professionally.

I'm comfortable with Docker for containerization. TRUB.AI is fully containerized. I've worked with Redis for caching, particularly at Efectura.

I build REST APIs extensively. I've implemented OAuth authentication. I have basic AWS deployment experience with EC2 and S3.

For Python, I use it in my TRUB.AI personal project with FastAPI, and I have production experience with it from the AI Document Reader. I work with FastAPI for building APIs.

I have production experience with LangGraph, Weaviate, and RAG pipelines from the AI Document Reader. I used LangChain for chunking and Ollama for running local LLMs. I work with LLMs and AI-assisted development. I use Claude and Claude Code daily, and I also work with Ollama for secure, local LLM work.

For frontend, I use React professionally. I'm comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I work with TypeScript and I'm confident about it. I'm actively improving my skills there. I understand modern JavaScript with ES6+, async/await patterns, React hooks, and state management.

I focus more on the backend, though I'm comfortable across the full stack.

I have some exposure to xUnit and Moq for testing, though it's limited because my client at Umelle didn't want tests. I created and improved a WiX installer for the AI Document Reader. I built a Windows Forms application for licensing.

I've implemented banking APIs twice in personal projects, so I'm familiar with financial data handling and payment flows.

I haven't done formal code reviews in production, but I've mentored friends who are learning to code and I'm open to mentoring responsibilities.

### What I'm Learning

I'm actively learning Node.js and TypeScript for backend development through my TRUB.AI rewrite. I don't have production experience with Node.js backend yet, but I'm building that skill.

I've played around with Kubernetes but don't have production experience with it yet. I have awareness of microservices architecture and slight experience with it, but not deep production experience. I've played around with RabbitMQ and have slight exposure to Kafka.

I've explored Domain-Driven Design and CQRS in personal projects, though not in production yet. I've also explored gRPC at an exploration level.

### What I Don't Have Experience With

I don't have experience with Java or Spring Boot, though I'm willing to learn. I don't have experience with Kotlin, Ruby, or Ruby on Rails. I don't have experience with Terraform or infrastructure as code. I have limited GraphQL experience, just early freelance exposure.

I don't have experience with React Native or mobile development. I don't have experience with ASP.NET MVC. I don't have experience with VB.NET or WPF. My desktop application experience is limited to Windows Forms. I primarily build web applications.

I don't have experience with Angular, Next.js, Vue.js, or Svelte. I use React instead. I don't have experience with MongoDB or Elasticsearch. I don't have experience with Oracle databases. I work with Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

I'm not experienced with pure DevOps or SRE roles. I don't have deep AWS experience, just basic EC2 and S3 deployment.

I'm aware of event-driven architecture with slight exposure, but not production experience. I don't practice Test-Driven Development regularly.

## INTERESTS AND GOALS

I'm passionate about combining my interests in music, technology, and AI. TRUB.AI is a perfect example of this. It merges my background as a trumpet player and sound engineer with my software development skills.

What gives me energy is solving technical problems, combining my interests, having autonomy, and making direct impact. What absorbs my energy is excessive bureaucracy, long meetings without outcomes, and being blocked on tasks.

### AI and LLMs

I'm really excited about AI and LLMs. The AI Document Reader project gave me hands-on production experience with RAG pipelines using LangGraph, Weaviate, and Ollama.

One LLM application that excites me is Claude Code. I love the agentic behavior and how it understands codebase context. What keeps me curious about AI is seeing tools become collaborators and the challenge of making them reliable in production.

Moshi is amazing. I've fine-tuned a Moshi model for my personal audio presentation. It introduces me and answers questions about my background and projects.

For my TRUB.AI audio machine learning work, I trained that binary classifier for trumpet detection. When it failed on edge cases, I learned a lot about the importance of hybrid approaches combining machine learning with traditional signal processing.

### Music

My ultimate goal is to become a full-time musician in about fifteen years. I'm a beginner trumpet player, and I practice regularly. My teacher, Imer Demirer, is one of the greatest trumpet players in Turkey. He declined an invitation to tour with Herbie Hancock.

I worked for three years as a professional Tonmeister at a jazz club in Istanbul. That experience taught me a lot about live sound, acoustics, and the practical side of audio engineering.

### Personal Life

I enjoy playing basketball. I have my dog Brankica who keeps me company. I appreciate the calm life in Belgrade. I'm from Turkey originally, but I'm enjoying living in Serbia.
